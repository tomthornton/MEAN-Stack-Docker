# Choice of Client Framework

Angular

# Status: accepted

# Context: 

Angular is one of the most popular Javascript frameworks available.

# Decision:

Angular was chosen because it provides a lot of great features out of the box, unlike React that requires a lot of third-party libraries. These features include advanced asynchronus functionality, material design components, and service injection as a core functionality that provides the exact access to information that each component needs.

Angular is built using an MVC design. It does this by using static HTML files for the View, which corresponds to a typescript class which defines the component's business logic (Controller). It also uses services to control the Model and update data as needed.


# Consequences: 

Angular has a steep learning curve, due to it's use of typescript (a strict-typing superset of Javascript).
