# Choice of Database Management System

NodeJS/Express/Angular

# Status: accepted

# Context: 

Express is a library of sequential middlewares that run on a NodeJS server. This allows you to define your own API for the client to interface with. Mongoose is a node dependency that makes it very easy to add CRUD features that interact with MongoDB. CRUD features are important because they allow the user to transform the data by changing it, deleting it, or creating it.

# Decision:

The NodeJs server and express are an extremely important part of the MEAN stack because they allow developers to create REST-ful API's very easily. REST API's are important because they create a unified way to access an application from anything that can make an XMLHTTP request.

# Consequences: 

Express, NodeJs, and Mongoose are all separate things that take time to learn, and then more time to learn how they interact in the overall picture. However, once it is running and you understand why, it's smooth sailing.
